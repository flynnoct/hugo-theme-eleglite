Eleglite (Elegant + Lite) is a Hugo theme crafted to bring back the simplicity and distraction-free style of the Web 1.0 era. Its design philosophy is minimal yet elegant, offering a clean and refined look for modern websites.

As my very first front-end project, Eleglite holds a special place in my heart. I drew significant inspiration from the design of [Neverland](https://type.cyhsu.xyz), which greatly influenced the aesthetic and functionality of this theme.
